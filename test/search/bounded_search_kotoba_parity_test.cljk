(ns search.bounded-search-kotoba-parity-test
  "Parity between `search.model`'s search machinery (.cljc) and
  `search.bounded-search` (.kotoba).

  The same inputs are driven through both sides: the Clojure namespace is
  called directly, the Kotoba side is compiled with the repo's own `:kotoba`
  alias (js-browser target) and executed by node. What is asserted:

    * token-count  == (count (model/tokenize text))
    * token-text n == (nth (model/tokenize text) n), for every n
    * token-start / token-end name a BYTE range of the ORIGINAL text whose
      lower-cased slice IS that token -- re-sliced here on the JVM, so a
      guest that returned plausible-looking offsets cannot pass
    * term-count   == (model/term-count term text)
    * score-doc    == (model/score-doc default-weights (tokenize q) doc)

  The one structural divergence the guest documents in its header is honored:
  the .cljc tokenize returns a VECTOR and this backend admits no readable
  collection of strings, so the guest exposes the INDEXED face (count + nth
  token + its byte range) that segment-text / segment-count-text already use
  for split. Everything built ON tokenize is a number and ports exactly.

  The guest also REFUSES two code points rather than answering wrongly:
  U+0130 and U+212A are the only non-ASCII code points that lower-case into
  [a-z0-9] (enumerated over all of Unicode on both hosts, 2026-09-08), and
  the guest folds ASCII only. `refuses-exactly-where-the-fold-diverges`
  pins BOTH halves -- the guest takes the error arm, AND the oracle really
  does answer differently there. A refusal nobody can show a divergence for
  is decoration."
